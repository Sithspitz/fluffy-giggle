# fluffy-giggle Vectra Panel Analysis Scripts (PhD)

# Background
These scripts are based on the data tidy scripts in solid-happiness

# Tidy Scripts Dir
In this directory you can find the Tidy Scripts which take the raw data from InForm export files and tidy them up into something managable.

# Total Data Collation Dir
This directory is the step after using the Tidy Scripts. This collates all the data together into a useful file. e.g. the stromatumour_only data are all collated together for all the different sections of different mutations.
